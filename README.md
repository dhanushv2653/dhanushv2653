### Engineer | Python Developer | Full-Stack Developer

I am an engineering-focused developer with a background in **drones, aerospace systems, and structural analysis**, now building **software solutions that support engineering decision-making and scalable applications**.

My work spans **Python-based engineering analysis**, **data-driven trade studies**, and **full-stack web development**, allowing me to bridge physical systems thinking with modern software practices.

I have hands-on experience in **UAV structural design and analysis**, where I applied analytical methods, simulation tools, and Python scripting to evaluate design trade-offs such as stiffness, mass, and thrust-to-weight performance. In parallel, I develop **backend-driven web applications**, focusing on clean architecture, APIs, and maintainable systems.

Rather than switching domains, I focus on **integrating engineering reasoning with software development** to build reliable, scalable, and explainable systems.

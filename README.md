### Full-Stack Developer | Software Engineering Enthusiast

I am a full-stack developer transitioning from a drones & aerospace background into building scalable web applications. I’ve completed my learning in **Node.js & Express** and am currently working on a **real-world web project for a company**, focusing on backend development, API design, and application structure.

My earlier work with drone systems helped me develop strong problem-solving skills, precision in engineering workflows, and a disciplined approach to building reliable systems — which I now apply to software development.
